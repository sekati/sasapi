= Project Roadmap =

SASAPI is constantly evolving, being refined, added to and built upon.  Here is some brief commentary on what you can except from future revisions:


= Actionscript 2.0 =

AS2 development will likely continue spurred by legacy and professional projects:
  * Filling of hole, gaps or other logical voids in functionality.
  * Bug fixes & feature additions.
  * Continued refinement of overall framework.
  * Buildfile cleanup, setup and usage documentation added.

= Actionscript 3.0 =

AS3 development will likely begin in the near future, including:
  * porting large portions of AS2 *SASAPI* wherever logical.
  * refactoring code to be more AS3 compliant (event systems, etc).
