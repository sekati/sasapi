= Project Roadmap =

SASAPI is constantly evolving, being refined, added to and built upon.  Here is some brief commentary on what you can except from future revisions:


= Foundation =

  * Buildfile cleanup and SVN feature additions.
  * Document Buildfile usage.
  * Move to an AS2 & AS3 compatible documentation system (Natural docs?).
  * Incorporate automated unit testing for AS3 and possibly AS2 (?).


= Actionscript 2.0 =

AS2 development will likely continue spurred by legacy and professional projects:
  * Filling of hole, gaps or other logical voids in functionality.
  * Bug fixes & feature additions.
  * Continued refinement of overall framework.


= Actionscript 3.0 =

AS3 development will likely begin in the near future, including:
  * porting large portions of AS2 *SASAPI* wherever logical.
  * refactoring code to be more AS3 compliant (event systems, etc).
