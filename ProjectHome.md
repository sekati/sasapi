**SASAPI** is a multipurpose Actionscript 2.0 framework designed to bootstrap the development process for flash (>=8) sites and applications. It is the predecessor to the [SEKATI (AS3) API](http://sekati.googlecode.com) and boasts a flexible structure, large collection of useful classes, utilities, test files and application skeletons.

A [Buildfile](http://sasapi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build.xml) is included with Ant tasks for creating projects, compiling swfs, generating documentation, archiving builds and fully automating deployment through rsync+ssh.

Specific attention has been paid to writing thorough and concise [Documentation for SASAPI](http://code.sekati.com/docs/sasapi/) and generating useful [Unit Tests](http://code.sekati.com/api/sasapi/tests/) to allow the framework to be easily tapped and referenced as needed.
