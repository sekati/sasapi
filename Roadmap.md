# Project Roadmap #

SASAPI is constantly evolving, being refined, added to and built upon.  Here is some brief commentary on what you can except from future revisions:


# Foundation #

  * ~~Incorporate~~ [Tweener](http://code.google.com/p/tweener/) ~~as the main tween engine for both AS2 and AS3.~~
  * Work with [swfIN](http://code.google.com/p/swfin/) and port swfAddress to swfIN to replace Flink.
  * ~~Buildfile cleanup and SVN feature additions.~~
  * ~~Document Buildfile usage.~~
  * ~~Move to an AS2 & AS3 compatible documentation system (AS2API + ASDoc).~~
  * ~~Incorporate automated unit testing for AS3 and possibly AS2 (?).~~


# Actionscript 2.0 #

AS2 development will likely continue spurred by legacy and professional projects:
  * ~~Filling of hole, gaps or other logical voids in functionality.~~
  * ~~Bug fixes & feature additions.~~
  * ~~Continued refinement of overall framework.~~


# Actionscript 3.0 #

AS3 development will likely begin in the near future, including:
  * Please see SASAPI's successor the [Sekati AS3 API](http://sekati.googlecode.com).
  * ~~porting large portions of AS2 **SASAPI** wherever logical.~~
  * ~~refactoring code to be more AS3 compliant (event systems, etc).~~
